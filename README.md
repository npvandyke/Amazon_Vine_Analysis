# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Using PySpark to perform an ETL on Amazon product reviews and determine bias for Vine reviews 

# Overview of the analysis: 
In this anaylsis, I selected an Amazon dataset containing reviews on pet products, and used PySpark to perform an ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, I used PySpark to determine whether there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members vs. unpaid reviews in the dataset.

# Results: 

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
# Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
